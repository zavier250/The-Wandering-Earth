                <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
                <p>
                    Millions of people live near volcanoes. From Italy’s Mount Vesuvius to Hawaii’s Kilauea, there are plenty of populated areas nestled in the shadows of volcanoes. The Indonesian island Java, for example, is home to more than 120 million people living near 30 volcanoes. National Geographic reports that these volcanoes have been fatal for over 140,000 people in the last 500 years. Death doesn’t just come from lava, either. Suffocating mud, toxic smoke, and even tsunamis can occur as a result of a volcanic explosion.

                            <h1>Danger-Of-Volcano-Eruption</h1>
                            <p>
                                Erupting volcanoes can pose many hazards, not only in the immediate vicinity of the eruption. One such hazard is that volcanic ash can be a threat to aircraft, in particular those with jet engines where ash particles can be melted by the high operating temperature; the melted particles then adhere to the turbine blades and alter their shape, disrupting the operation of the turbine. Large eruptions can affect temperature as ash and droplets of sulfuric acid obscure the sun and cool the Earth's lower atmosphere (or troposphere); however, they also absorb heat radiated from the Earth, thereby warming the upper atmosphere (or stratosphere). Historically, volcanic winters have caused catastrophic famines.

                            <h2>Volcanic gases</h2>
                            <p>
                                The concentrations of different volcanic gases can vary considerably from one volcano to the next. Water vapor is typically the most abundant volcanic gas, followed by carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide. Other principal volcanic gases include hydrogen sulfide, hydrogen chloride, and hydrogen fluoride. A large number of minor and trace gases are also found in volcanic emissions, for example hydrogen, carbon monoxide, halocarbons, organic compounds, and volatile metal chlorides.
                            </p>
                            <div class="popup-img">
                                <img src="/images/vol-pop3.png" alt="volcanic-gas">
                            </div>
                            <p>
                                Large, explosive volcanic eruptions inject water vapor(H2O), carbon dioxide strong(CO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), hydrogen chloride (HCl), hydrogen fluoride (HF) and ash (pulverized rock and pumice) into the stratosphere to heights of 16–32 kilometres (10–20 mi) above the Earth's surface. The most significant impacts from these injections come from the conversion of sulfur dioxide to sulfuric acid (H2SO4), which condenses rapidly in the stratosphere to form fine sulfate aerosols. The SO2 emissions alone of two different eruptions are sufficient to compare their potential climatic impact. The aerosols increase the Earth's albedo—its reflection of radiation from the Sun back into space—and thus cool the Earth's lower atmosphere or troposphere; however, they also absorb heat radiated up from the Earth, thereby warming the stratosphere. Several eruptions during the past century have caused a decline in the average temperature at the Earth's surface of up to half a degree (Fahrenheit scale) for periods of one to three years; sulfur dioxide from the eruption of Huaynaputina probably caused the Russian famine of 1601–1603.
                            </p>
                            <h2>Hazards</h2>
                            <p>
                                Ash thrown into the air by eruptions can present a hazard to aircraft, especially jet aircraft where the particles can be melted by the high operating temperature; the melted particles then adhere to the turbine blades and alter their shape, disrupting the operation of the turbine. Dangerous encounters in 1982 after the eruption of Galunggung in Indonesia, and 1989 after the eruption of Mount Redoubt in Alaska raised awareness of this phenomenon. Nine Volcanic Ash Advisory Centers were established by the International Civil Aviation Organization to monitor ash clouds and advise pilots accordingly. The 2010 eruptions of Eyjafjallajökull caused major disruptions to air travel in Europe.

                    <h4>Volcano Safety Tips</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li> As much as possible, stay away from active volcanoes. </li>
                        <li>If you live near an active volcano, keep goggles and a mask in an emergency kit, along with a flashlight and a working, battery-operated radio. </li>
                        <li>Know your evacuation route. Keep gas in your car. </li>
                    </ul>

                <div>
                    <h4>If a Volcano Erupts in Your Area</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Evacuate only as recommended by authorities to stay clear of lava, mud flows, and flying rocks and debris.</li>
                        <li>Avoid river areas and low-lying regions. </li>
                        <li> Before you leave the house, change into long-sleeved shirts and long pants and use goggles or eyeglasses, not contacts. Wear an emergency mask or hold a damp cloth over your face. </li>
                        <li>If you are not evacuating, close windows and doors and block chimneys and other vents, to prevent ash from coming into the house.</li>
                        <li>Be aware that ash may put excess weight on your roof and need to be swept away. Wear protection during cleanups.</li>
                        <li>Ash can damage engines and metal parts, so avoid driving. If you must drive, stay below 35 miles (56 kilometers) an hour.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Keep listening to your radio or television until you are told all is safe or you are told to evacuate. Local authorities may evacuate specific areas at greatest risk in your community.</li>
                            <li>Close and lock all windows and outside doors.</li>
                            <li>Turn off all heating and air conditioning systems and fans.</li>
                            <li>Close the fireplace damper.</li>
                            <li>Organize your emergency supplies and make sure household members know where the supplies are.</li>
                            <li>Make sure the radio is working.</li>
                            <li>Go to an interior room without windows that is above ground level.</li>
                            <li>Bring your pets with you, and be sure to bring additional food and water supplies for them.</li>
                            <li>It is ideal to have a hard-wired (non-portable) telephone in the room you select. Call your emergency contact—a friend or family member who does not live near the volcano—and have the phone available if you need to report a life-threatening condition. Remember that telephone equipment may be overwhelmed or damaged during an emergency.</li>

                        <h4>Distillation</h4>
                        <p>
                            While boiling and chlorination will kill most microbes in water, distillation will remove microbes (germs) that resist these methods, as well as heavy metals, salts and most other chemicals. Distillation involves boiling water and then collection of only the vapor that condenses. The condensed vapor will not include salt or most other impurities.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To distill, fill a pot halfway with water. Tie a cup to the handle on the pot’s lid so that the cup will hang right-side-up when the lid is upside-down (make sure the cup is not dangling into the water) and boil the water for 20 minutes. The water that drips from the lid into the cup is distilled.
                        </p>

                            Without electricity or a cold source, food stored in refrigerators and freezers can become unsafe. Bacteria in food grow rapidly at temperatures between 40 and 140 °F, and if these foods are consumed you can become very sick. Thawed food usually can be eaten if it is still “refrigerator cold.” It can be re-frozen if it still contains ice crystals. To be safe, remember, “When in doubt, throw it out.”
