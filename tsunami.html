                <p>
                        A tsunami can kill or injure people and damage or destroy buildings and infrastructure as waves come in and go out. A tsunami is a series of enormous ocean waves caused by earthquakes, underwater landslides, volcanic eruptions, or asteroids. Tsunamis can:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Travel 20-30 miles per hour with waves 10-100 feet high.</li>
                            <li>Cause flooding and disrupt transportation, power, communications, and the water supply.</li>
                            <li>Happen anywhere along U.S. coasts. Coasts that border the Pacific Ocean or Caribbean have the greatest risk.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h1>Causes of tsunamis</h1>
                        <p>
                            Over the years, people have come up with lots of reasons as to why tsunamis and other natural disasters   happen. Some say that it is the wrath of God for our sinful ways; others say that Mother Nature is getting back at us for destroying our natural resources and so on. The list is endless.

                            However what many people don’t know is that for a tsunami to occur, there is a chain of events that triggers the formation of these huge destructive waves we call tsunamis.

                        <h2>Underwater earthquakes</h2>
                        <p>
                            Over 85% tsunamis that have occurred over the years can be attributed to deep sea earthquakes. But the real cause lies in the origin of the earthquake. The surface of whole world is covered with tectonic plates which are constantly moving, some more than others.

                            The plates hold together at specific boundaries, and the type of boundary is determined by how one tectonic plate moves relative to the other: transform, where the two plates slide horizontally past each other; spreading, when the two tectonic plates are moving away from each other; subduction, when they are moving towards each other.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Volcanic activity</h2>
                        <p>
                            Volcanic eruptions also cause tsunamis. Like subduction zones, eruptions also release a lot of built up tension. That is why most volcanoes literally blow up during an eruption. Only underwater volcanoes or those that are very close to large water bodies can lead to tsunamis.

                            Normally, a volcanic eruption is usually preceded by a series of small earthquakes caused by the tension within the volcano. Or if the eruption is violent to the point that the volcano collapses into the adjoining sea, it will cause a large displacement of the water which will be transmitted into wave action that could lead to a tsunami.
                                
                            Violent underwater volcanic eruptions could lead to tsunamis. Earthquakes and volcanic activity usually go hand in hand because of the instability of the area. Apart from the high seismic activity in the area, the Ring of Fire is also famous for having the highest number of highly active volcanoes within close proximity of each other. The islands of Hawaii have survived several tsunamis that were the result of volcanic eruptions.

                        <p>
                            These are the main causes of tsunamis in the world; however, a tsunami can also be caused by a host of other natural phenomenon’s key among them landslides and extraterrestrial collisions such as meteors and other such objects falling to earth.

                        Tsunami shelters could be big enough to support a whole community or small enough just to support a family of four. It must be accessible and durable. Ideally, a tsunami shelter must be built on high ground with stable platforms. You must consider the materials being used to withstand the extreme pressure of the water waves. Read along to know some fundamentals in building a strong tsunami shelter.

                        Using concrete structures instead of wood is very efficient, even though wood is more resilient to earthquakes. Look for a specific concrete that doesn’t easily crack under water pressure. You should also consider the structural connectors, those that can absorb a great deal of stress are the ideal ones to use.

                            After an emergency, tap water may not be available or safe to drink. Individuals should prepare for emergencies by developing an emergency water supply for their home and by learning how to make contaminated water safe to drink.  
                            Individuals who use private wells, cisterns, or other rain-catchment systems for their water needs should also understand how to prepare for an emergency and disinfect these water sources after an emergency situation. Similarly, those in charge of community drinking water facilities should have plans in place in the event that service is interrupted.

                            he amount and kind of foods to store for an emergency depend on several factors: ages and special food needs of family members (i.e., special needs for infants, pregnant women, elderly); number of family members; food preferences; special health and diet needs; ability and equipment to prepare food; space for storage.
                            Short-term food supplies generally need to meet needs for liquid intake, energy and special diets. Longer-term priorities include nutritionally balanced daily diets. If needed, supplement diets with a daily multivitamin/mineral.
