                <h1>FIRE</h1>
                <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
                <p>
                    Of all the natural disasters, fire is the only one that is both beneficial to man and his environment as well as destructive and deadly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Man has depended on it for centuries for things from cooking and heating to a major source of lighting. And yet, thousands of people die each year as a result of either house fires or wildfires, with direct property loss estimated at $8.6 billion annually.

                            <h1>The Cause Of Fire</h1>
                            
                            <p>
                                You are only going to find fires in two places - and it makes sense - indoors or outdoors. Outdoors will be your forest fires or wildfires. Indoors will be building fires and house fires.
                            </p>
                            <h4>Major Causes of House Fires</h4>
                            <p>
                                Electrical accidents or neglect - misuse of wiring and electrical appliances, leaving a curling iron on, or an electric blanket, shorting out of small appliances such as lamps, toasters and even baby monitors.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Smoking – a dropped cigarette or children playing with matches and lighters, inadequate ashtray.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Kitchen accidents – unattended pots on the stove or the burner being left on accidentally.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Heating equipment – space heaters, gas heaters, wood stoves, and fireplaces, mainly in winter months. Portable heaters can be knocked over or placed too close to flammable materials, or they are inadequately guarded. All heaters could overheat if obstructed.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Burning refuse/rubbish – accumulating in work or storage areas.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Hazardous goods – materials such as paints, adhesives or other chemicals.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Arson – by mischievous children and adults, facilitated by ineffectively secured buildings.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Specific hazards – machinery in dusty environments, heated equipment (e.g. soldering irons), lamps, cutting and welding equipment, flammable liquids.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                The threat for people living near wildland areas or using recreational facilities in wilderness areas is real.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Dry conditions at various times of the year and in various parts of the United States greatly increase the potential for of this type of natural disaster.

                                Have a safe place to meet if you need to evacuate your home or the area. Be sure you have practiced evacuating so you have no surprises if a "real" event actually occurs. If you get split up, make sure everyone knows who to contact outside your area (grandma or a close family friend). That way, you all have a specific individual to keep track of everyone even if you all can't keep up with each other locally. It does happen when things get chaotic.

                        Fires need three things if they are going to continue to burn: Oxygen, heat and fuel. So, if you want to stop a fire, you have to eliminate at least one of those elements. Take away the oxygen and you can extinguish a fire. Take away the fuel, and you can put out a fire.

                       Upstairs is generally a more dangerous space to seek shelter during a bushfire. Upstairs levels are more difficult to escape from. Often they have large windows and sliding glass doors which are designed to capture views, but due to radiant heat and strong winds can crack and implode. Upper levels are often constructed of lightweight materials that are more flammable and vulnerable to direct flame contact from burning trees.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The ground floor is generally a safer space to shelter. The ground level usually has more external doors from which the occupant can escape. On a sloping block, however, the easiest level from which to exit may be the first floor. The ground level often has smaller windows (except those leading to entertainment areas). From the ground floor it is easier to get to the driveway and closer to an external water source such as a water tank.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        People often suggest the bathroom as a good place to shelter during a bushfire. However, the bathroom can also be dangerous. During a bushfire, mains water is often cut or the pressure is reduced to a trickle. Despite having tiled walls, non-combustible fittings and a water supply, bathrooms like other rooms are vulnerable to the collapse of a burning ceiling when embers have ignited in the roof cavity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Most bathrooms do not have an external door that residents can use to exit the house. In a bathroom it can be difficult to see the progress of a fire. And as bathrooms are small enclosed spaces they may be more vulnerable to carbon monoxide poisoning.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My advice is to look at all the external ground floor doors (while remembering that glass doors can be dangerous because of their vulnerability to radiant heat), and determine which of them provide access to adjoining outside paved, gravel, concrete or other non-combustible areas. You should also see if there is a small window from which you can observe the progress of the bushfire, and if there is a sink close by to store water. Where possible consider installing a fire alarm that has a carbon monoxide sensor with audible and visual alerts.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When you have identified the most suitable place in the house to actively shelter during a bushfire, follow the bushfire preparation activities provided by fire authorities. Some of these will include looking out of a window to follow the progress of the fire and being aware of current bushfire updates on the radio and via mobile phone. There is no such thing as passive sheltering.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Being inside your home as the fire passes offers more protection than being outside. But it should be seen as a last resort, with leaving early the preferred action. Fire agencies work hard to inform residents of days when bushfires are likely, and to provide updates on fires that do break out. Residents in bushfire-prone areas should take these warnings and updates seriously and leave their properties when advised to do so, especially when catastrophic fires are expected.
