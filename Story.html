                    More than three centuries ago, astrophysicists discovered a sudden acceleration in the conversion of hydrogen into helium inside the sun, sending tens of thousands of probes through the sun to build a complete and accurate mathematical model of the star.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Advanced computer on the calculation of the model results show that the evolution of the sun to drift outside the main sequence, helium fusion will spread in a very short period of time through the inside the sun, creating a called helium flash explosions, later, the sun will be turned into a huge but dim red giant, so big it, the earth will run inside the sun!
                </p>
                <p>
                    In fact, our planet was vaporized in the helium flash before this.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All this will happen in four hundred years, three hundred and eighty years.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Solar cataclysmic events will blow up and engulf all habitable earth-like planets in the solar system and cause all wood-like planets to completely change shape and orbit. Since the first helium flash, as the heavy elements repeatedly gather in the center of the sun, the solar helium flash will occur repeatedly over a period of time, relative to the evolution of stars, which may be as long as a thousand human histories. Therefore, the human in the future solar system can not survive, the only way to live is to outer space interstellar migration, and according to the current human technology, the only feasible target for all human migration is centauri proxima centauri, which is the nearest star, there are 4. Three light years away. A consensus has been reached, and the debate centers on immigration methods.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The flight of human beings is divided into five steps: the first step, with the earth engine to stop the rotation of the earth, the engine nozzle fixed in the opposite direction of the earth movement; The second step is to start the earth engine at full power, accelerating the earth to escape velocity and flying out of the solar system. Step three, continue accelerating in outer space toward proxima centauri; The fourth step, in the middle of the earth to re-rotation, turn the engine direction, began to slow down; In the fifth step, the earth is put into orbit around proxima centauri, a satellite of the star. People call this five-step respectively called braking time, elapsed time, stray era Ⅰ Ⅱ (acceleration), stray era (slow), the new solar era.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The whole process will take 2,500 years, a hundred generations.

                <h1>ESCAPE AGE（excerpt）</h1>
                <p>
                    In the age of escape, cataclysm ensues.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The balance of the iron-nickel core in the earth's core is disturbed by acceleration and changes in orbit caused by earth's engines, which affect the mantle through the Gutenberg discontinuity. Continental geothermal vents and volcanic eruptions are deadly threats to humanity's underground cities. After the sixth orbit shift, magma infiltration disasters occurred frequently in the dungeons of various continents.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I arrived at the central square, I saw a long line of people by age. The one closest to the elevator is the baby held by the robot nurse, then the kindergarten children, and then the primary school students... I was in the front of the line. My father is on duty in low earth orbit. My mother and I are the only ones in the city. I can't see my mother now. I know she is in the last paragraph, because this city is mainly a school center, and there are very few families. She is already one of the older group.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Two and a half hours after I reached the surface, magma engulfed the city at a depth of 500 meters. I thought bitterly of my mother's last moments, watching the lava pour into the central square with 18,000 people who had not been able to evacuate. By then the power had gone out, and the only thing left of the dungeon was the ghastly red glow of magma. The tall white dome of the square gradually turned black in the heat, all the victims may not have touched the magma, the temperature of this thousand degrees on the killing.
