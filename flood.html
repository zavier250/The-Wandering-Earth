                <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
                <p>
                    Failing to evacuate flooded areas, entering flood waters, or remaining after a flood has passed can result in injury or death. Flooding is a temporary overflow of water onto land that is normally dry. Floods are the most common natural disaster in the United States. Floods may:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Result from rain, snow, coastal storms, storm surges, and overflows of dams and other water systems.</li>
                            <li>Develop slowly or quickly – Flash floods can come with no warning.</li>
                            <li>Cause outages, disrupt transportation, damage buildings, and create landslides.</li>
                        </ul>

                            <p>
                                A flood occurs when water inundates land that's normally dry, which can happen in a multitude of ways.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Excessive rain, a ruptured dam or levee, rapid melting of snow or ice, or even an unfortunately placed beaver dam can overwhelm a river, spreading over the adjacent land, called a floodplain. Coastal flooding occurs when a large storm or tsunami causes the sea to surge inland.
                            </p>
                            <div class="popup-img">

                            <p>
                                Most floods take hours or even days to develop, giving residents time to prepare or evacuate. Others generate quickly and with little warning. So-called flash floods can be extremely dangerous, instantly turning a babbling brook or even a dry wash into rushing rapids that sweep everything in their path downstream.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Climate change is increasing the risk of floods worldwide, particularly in coastal and low-lying areas, because of its role in extreme weather events and rising seas. The increase in temperatures that accompanies global warming can contribute to hurricanes that move more slowly and drop more rain, funneling moisture into atmospheric rivers like the ones that led to heavy rains and flooding in California in early 2019.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Meanwhile, melting glaciers and other factors are contributing to a rise in sea levels that has created long-term, chronic flooding risks for places ranging from Venice, Italy to the Marshall Islands. More than 670 U.S. communities will face repeated flooding by the end of this century, according to a 2017 analysis; it's happening in more than 90 coastal communities already.

                            <h2>Impacts of flooding</h2>
                            <p>
                                Floods cause more than $40 billion in damage worldwide annually, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. In the U.S., losses average close to $8 billion a year. Death tolls have increased in recent decades to more than 100 people a year. In China's Yellow River Valley some of the world's worst floods have killed millions of people.
                            </p>

                            </div>
                            <p>
                                When floodwaters recede, affected areas are often blanketed in silt and mud. The water and landscape can be contaminated with hazardous materials such as sharp debris, pesticides, fuel, and untreated sewage. Potentially dangerous mold blooms can quickly overwhelm water-soaked structures.
                            </p> 
                            <p>     
                                Residents of flooded areas can be left without power and clean drinking water, leading to outbreaks of deadly waterborne diseases like typhoid, hepatitis A, and cholera.

                            <li>Water can be purified at home or safe water can be purchased.</li>
                            <li>Water may either be boiled or regular household bleach may be added, such as Clorox or Purex brands or any store brand.</li>
                            <li>To boil, bring water to a rolling boil and keep it boiling for approximately 3 minutes.  Pour water into disinfected drinking container (instructions for disinfecting containers provided below).Store in refrigerator if possible.</li>
                            <li>To use household bleach, strain the water through a coffee filter or cheese cloth to remove dirt and other particles. Use 1/8 teaspoon (or 6-8 drops from a dropper) of regular household bleach to a gallon of water. Let stand for 30 minutes.  If water is still cloudy after 30 minutes, add another 1/8 teaspoon (or 6-8 drops from a dropper) of regular household bleach per gallon and let the water stand another 30 minutes.</li>
                            <li>Do not use more than the recommended amount of bleach.  Large amounts can be poisonous.</li>
