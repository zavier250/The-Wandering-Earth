                <h1>EXTREME WEATHER</h1>
                <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
                <p>
                    There’s been a change in the weather. Extreme events like the Nashville flood—described by officials as a once-in-a-millennium occurrence—are happening more frequently than they used to. A month before Nashville, torrential downpours dumped 11 inches of rain on Rio de Janeiro in 24 hours, triggering mud slides that buried hundreds. About three months after Nashville, record rains in Pakistan caused flooding that affected more than 20 million people. In late 2011 floods in Thailand submerged hundreds of factories near Bangkok, creating a worldwide shortage of computer hard drives.

                            <h1>Weather Gone Wild</h1>
                            <p>
                                As the world has warmed, that warming has triggered many other changes to the Earth’s climate. Changes in extreme weather and climate events, such as heat waves and droughts, are the primary way that most people experience climate change. Human-induced climate change has already increased the number and strength of some of these extreme events. Over the last 50 years, much of the U.S. has seen increases in prolonged periods of excessively high temperatures, heavy downpours, and in some regions, severe floods and droughts.
                            </p>
                            <h4>Heat Waves</h4>
                            <p>
                                Heat waves are periods of abnormally hot weather lasting days to weeks. The number of heat waves has been increasing in recent years. This trend has continued in 2011 and 2012, with the number of intense heat waves being almost triple the long-term average. The recent heat waves and droughts in Texas (2011) and the Midwest (2012) set records for highest monthly average temperatures. Analyses show that human-induced climate change has generally increased the probability of heat waves., And prolonged (multi-month) extreme heat has been unprecedented since the start of reliable instrumental records in 1895.

                            <h4>Drought</h4>
                            <p>
                                Higher temperatures lead to increased rates of evaporation, including more loss of moisture through plant leaves. Even in areas where precipitation does not decrease, these increases in surface evaporation and loss of water from plants lead to more rapid drying of soils if the effects of higher temperatures are not offset by other changes (such as reduced wind speed or increased humidity). As soil dries out, a larger proportion of the incoming heat from the sun goes into heating the soil and adjacent air rather than evaporating its moisture, resulting in hotter summers under drier climatic conditions.

                            <h4>Heavy Downpours</h4>
                            <p>
                                Heavy downpours are increasing nationally, especially over the last three to five decades. The heaviest rainfall events have become heavier and more frequent, and the amount of rain falling on the heaviest rain days has also increased. Since 1991, the amount of rain falling in very heavy precipitation events has been significantly above average. This increase has been greatest in the Northeast, Midwest, and upper Great Plains – more than 30% above the 1901-1960 average. There has also been an increase in flooding events in the Midwest and Northeast, where the largest increases in heavy rain amounts have occurred.

                            <h4>Hurricanes</h4>
                            <p>
                                There has been a substantial increase in most measures of Atlantic hurricane activity since the early 1980s, the period during which high quality satellite data are available.,, These include measures of intensity, frequency, and duration as well as the number of strongest (Category 4 and 5) storms. The recent increases in activity are linked, in part, to higher sea surface temperatures in the region that Atlantic hurricanes form in and move through. Numerous factors have been shown to influence these local sea surface temperatures, including natural variability, human-induced emissions of heat-trapping gases, and particulate pollution. Quantifying the relative contributions of natural and human-caused factors is an active focus of research.
                            </p> 
                            <div class="popup-img">

                            <p>     
                                Hurricane development, however, is influenced by more than just sea surface temperature. How hurricanes develop also depends on how the local atmosphere responds to changes in local sea surface temperatures, and this atmospheric response depends critically on the cause of the change., For example, the atmosphere responds differently when local sea surface temperatures increase due to a local decrease of particulate pollution that allows more sunlight through to warm the ocean, versus when sea surface temperatures increase more uniformly around the world due to increased amounts of human-caused heat-trapping gases.

                    <h4>What To Expect</h4>
                    <p>
                        For all the things that humans can control on planet Earth, we are still at the mercy of climate and weather. We can’t stop a storm. We can’t change its trajectory. All we can do is prepare.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Storms and natural disasters occur with increasing frequency and severity so, now, more than ever, it’s critical to be prepared. Here are a few steps you can take to make sure that you and your family are ready the next time a tornado, blizzard, hurricane or severe thunderstorm strikes:

                        </div>
                        <div class='stats'>
                            <p><strong>1. Own a generator in case the power goes out.</strong> A portable generator will allow you to operate sump pumps, heaters and critical appliances to keep your family and property safe. The Cat® RP Series portable generators are great for backup power and come in a variety of sizes, depending on your needs.</p>
                            <p><strong>2. Store your generator properly to ensure it starts up when you need it to:</strong> Stale fuel is the number one reason that gas generators won’t start so always drain the fuel for long term storage. For short term storage, use a fuel stabilizer and set a monthly reminder on your phone to start your generator and let it run for a few minutes – this will help prevent gum build up in your carburetor.</p>
                            <p><strong>3. Maintain emergency supplies</strong> – fresh water, flashlights, batteries, non-perishable foods, etc. – and check your stockpile regularly to make sure your supply is fresh. FEMA recommends keeping a 2 weeks supply of food and water, including 1 gallon of water for each family member per day. You should also keep a supply of fresh gas for your generator.</p>
                            <p><strong>4. Have an emergency family plan in place</strong> so that family members know where to evacuate and/or reunite in case anyone gets separated. Practice that plan once a year to make sure it’s fresh in your minds in the heat of the moment.</p>

                                <p><strong>5. Prepare for a Power Outage:</strong> unplug appliances (protect against electrical surges), turn off any propane tanks, fill your car and fuel cans (for your generator) with gas and dial up the cold settings on your refrigerator and freezer so they’ll keep food colder, longer if you lose power.</p>
                                <p><strong>6. Stay up to date on weather forecasts and alerts.</strong> Listen to a NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) weather radio or download the NOAA app for your smartphone to get alerts if you need to take cover.</p>
                                <p><strong>7. Know the safest place in your home and plan to stay there during the storm.</strong> If you have a basement, this will be the safest location. If not, a bathroom (hunker down in the shower or tub) or room in the center of the house, away from any windows is usually the safest option.</p>
                                <p><strong>8. Keep your shoes and wallet close by.</strong> If you have to take cover from a tornado or hurricane, it’s best to have these items with you in case your home is destroyed and you have to crawl out of the debris. DO NOT delay taking cover to search for shoes or other items – better to come out alive and barefoot than get caught in the storm.</p>
                            </div>

                        <div class='stats'>
                            <p><strong>9. Avoid drinking or preparing food with tap water until you’re certain it’s not contaminated.</strong></p>
                            <p><strong>10. If you’re able, let friends and family know that you’re safe.</strong> The Facebook “I’m Safe” tool is a good option for major crisis situations.</p>
                            <p>11. Lastly, if you do own a Cat Portable Generator, <strong>be generous with your neighbors and share your power</strong> so they can charge their phones, etc. Neighborhoods and communities need to pull together most after crises and natural disasters.</p>

                    <p>
                        A storm shelter or storm cellar is a type of underground bunker designed to protect the occupants from violent severe weather, particularly tornadoes. They are most frequently seen in the Midwest ("Tornado Alley") and Southeastern United States where tornadoes are generally frequent and the low water table permits underground structures.

                <h4>How to dress in extreme cold weather</h4>
                <p>
                    It is essential to dress in loose, layered clothing that can be added and removed as necessary per activity level. Tight clothes act the exact opposite of what you think. They don’t insulate and they restrict blood flow, which is a vital part of keeping our body temperature regulated.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Plan for three to five layers, depending on how cold it is. Start with a base layer and end with a shell.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Your base layer, or bottom first layer, is your moisture-wicking layer. Do not wear cotton. Cotton does not absorb moisture. You can wear long underwear or thermals in wool, silk, or other synthetic material that controls and wicks moisture.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Your middle layers are the ones that keep you warm. Fleece, wool, and fleece/wool blends are good choices for this layer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The outer layer, or shell, needs to be a coat or jacket with a collar, preferably with a waist you can cinch and is completely waterproof. Gore-Tex is a popular choice. Pick a coat that has enough room to comfortably fit your layers, plus leave room for ventilation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    40 to 45 percent of our body heat is lost through our head, neck, wrist and ears, so cover them up! Mittens are warmer than gloves and wear your stocking cap, beanie, or skull cap, even when you are sleeping.
